 abstract={Abstract:  The recent boom of large-scale Online Social Networks (OSNs) both enables and necessitates the use of parallelisable and scalable computational techniques for their analysis. We examine the problem of real-time community detection and a recently proposed linear time - O(m) on a network with m edges - label propagation or "epidemic" community detection algorithm. We identify characteristics and drawbacks of the algorithm and extend it by incorporating different heuristics to facilitate reliable and multifunctional real-time community detection. With limited computational resources, we employ the algorithm on OSN data with 1 million nodes and about 58 million directed edges. Experiments and benchmarks reveal that the extended algorithm is not only faster but its community detection accuracy is compared favourably over popular modularity-gain optimization algorithms known to suffer from their resolution limits.},

 abstract={Abstract:  An important challenge in big data analysis nowadays is detection of cohesive groups in large-scale networks, including social networks, genetic networks, communication networks and so. In this paper, we propose LabelRank, an efficient algorithm detecting communities through label propagation. A set of operators is introduced to control and stabilize the propagation dynamics. These operations resolve the randomness issue in traditional label propagation algorithms (LPA), stabilizing the discovered communities in all runs of the same network. Tests on real-world networks demonstrate that LabelRank significantly improves the quality of detected communities compared to LPA, as well as other popular algorithms.},
