 abstract={Abstract:  The recent boom of large-scale Online Social Networks (OSNs) both enables and necessitates the use of parallelisable and scalable computational techniques for their analysis. We examine the problem of real-time community detection and a recently proposed linear time - O(m) on a network with m edges - label propagation or "epidemic" community detection algorithm. We identify characteristics and drawbacks of the algorithm and extend it by incorporating different heuristics to facilitate reliable and multifunctional real-time community detection. With limited computational resources, we employ the algorithm on OSN data with 1 million nodes and about 58 million directed edges. Experiments and benchmarks reveal that the extended algorithm is not only faster but its community detection accuracy is compared favourably over popular modularity-gain optimization algorithms known to suffer from their resolution limits.},

 abstract={Abstract:  An important challenge in big data analysis nowadays is detection of cohesive groups in large-scale networks, including social networks, genetic networks, communication networks and so. In this paper, we propose LabelRank, an efficient algorithm detecting communities through label propagation. A set of operators is introduced to control and stabilize the propagation dynamics. These operations resolve the randomness issue in traditional label propagation algorithms (LPA), stabilizing the discovered communities in all runs of the same network. Tests on real-world networks demonstrate that LabelRank significantly improves the quality of detected communities compared to LPA, as well as other popular algorithms.},

 abstract={Due to the considerable time and expense required in labeling data, a challenge is to propose learning algorithms that can learn from a small amount of labeled data and a much larger amount of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose one such algorithm which uses an evolutionary strategy to iteratively adjust the class membership of the patterns in the unlabeled sample. The iterative adjustment is done so that the class conditional distribution obtained from such a labeling allows a maximum a posteriori classification with minimum classification error on the labeled patterns. We detail the algorithm and provide results obtained by the proposed algorithm on 5 different datasets.},

 abstract={The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O (md log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m approximately n and d approximately log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O (n log(2) n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2 x 10(6) edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

 abstract={Networks portray a multitude of interactions through which people meet, ideas are spread, and infectious diseases propagate within a society. Identifying the most efficient "spreaders" in a network is an important step to optimize the use of available resources and ensure the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to the most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we find: (i) The most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. (ii) When multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously, the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extend of the spreading. Furthermore, we find that-- in the case of infections that do not confer immunity on recovered individuals-- the infection persists in the high k-shell layers of the network under conditions where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our analysis provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies.},
