 abstract={CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles): How do real graphs evolve over time? What are “normal” growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) orO(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a “forest fire” spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the “flammability” of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.},

 abstract={Summary: Relationships in Microblogging services are lack of explicit meaningful labels, such as “colleagues”, “family members”, etc. The state-of-the-arts mainly work on mining only one particular relationship type such as advisor-advisee relationship for specific social networks. Moreover, few work focuses on relationship identification in Microblog based on link analysis. In Microblog, words in interactive tweets between users may provide clues for relationship type identification. In this study, we propose a two-step framework to infer the different social relationship types between users in Microblog. Firstly, a generative model UIRCT (User Interaction-based Relationship-related Community Topic) is proposed to discover relationship-related communities based on interactive content between users. We then profile the discovered communities with different relationship type labels by utilizing external resource. Experiment results on Sina Weibo dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can identify different meaningful relationship types effectively.},

 abstract={Network structure and content in microblogging sites like Twitter influence each other - user A on Twitter follows user B for the tweets that B posts on the network, and A may then re-tweet the content shared by B to his/her own followers. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to jointly model link communities and content topics by leveraging both the social graph and the content shared by users. We model a community as a distribution over users, use it as a source for topics of interest, and jointly infer both communities and topics using Gibbs sampling. While modeling communities using the social graph, or modeling topics using content have received a great deal of attention, a few recent approaches try to model topics in content-sharing platforms using both content and social graph. Our work differs from the existing generative models in that we explicitly model the social graph of users along with the user-generated content, mimicking how the two entities co-evolve in content-sharing platforms. Recent studies have found Twitter to be more of a content-sharing network and less a social network, and it seems hard to detect tightly knit communities from the follower-followee links. Still, the question of whether we can extract Twitter communities using both links and content is open. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our model discovers coherent communities and topics, as evinced by qualitative results on sub-graphs of Twitter users. Furthermore, we evaluate our model on the task of predicting follower-followee links. We show that joint modeling of links and content significantly improves link prediction performance on a sub-graph of Twitter (consisting of about 0.7 million users and over 27 million tweets), compared to generative models based on only structure or only content and paths-based methods such as Katz.},

 abstract={Online social networks have been wildly spread in recent years. They enable users to identify other users with common interests, exchange their opinions, and expertise. Discovering user communities from social networks have become one of the major challenges which help its members to interact with relevant people who have similar interests. Community detection approaches fall into two categories: the first one considers user' networks while the other utilizes usergenerated content. In this paper, a multi-layer community detection model based on identifying topics of interest from user published content is presented. This model applies Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine for modeling user's posts within a social network which yields to identify their topics of interest, and finally construct communities. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-layer model is measured using KL divergence which measures similarity between users of the same community. Experiments on the real Twitter dataset show that the proposed deep model outperforms traditional community detection models that directly maps users into corresponding communities using several baseline techniques.},

With the development of social media, a lot of user-generated content is available with user networks. Along with rich information in networks, user graphs can be extended with text information associated with nodes. Topic modeling is a classic problem in text mining and it is interesting to discover the latent topics in text-associated graphs. Different from traditional topic modeling methods considering links, we incorporate community discovery into topic analysis in text-associated graphs to guarantee the topical coherence in the communities so that users in the same community are closely linked to each other and share common latent topics. We handle topic modeling and community discovery in the same framework. In our model we separate the concepts of community and topic, so one community can correspond to multiple topics and multiple communities can share the same topic. We compare different methods and perform extensive experiments on two real datasets. The results confirm our hypothesis that topics could help understand community structure, while community structure could help model topics.},

Social network provide a rich source of heterogeneous data which can be exploited to discover previously unknown relationships and interests among groups of people. In this paper, we address the problem of discovering topically meaningful communities from a social network. We assume that a persons' membership in a community is conditioned on its social relationship, the type of interaction and the information communicated with other members of that community. We propose generative models that can discover communities based on the discussed topics, interaction types and the social connections among people. In our models a person can belong to multiple communities and a community can participate in multiple topics. This allows us to discover both community interests and user interests based on the information and linked associations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two real word data sets and show that it performs better than existing community discovery models.},

Then a topic distance between users is defined, which depends on the bookmarking relationships between users and tags.

To implement the framework, besides proposing techniques for preprocessing tweet data, we develop an unsupervised learning method called MbCLARANS, which is an optimized CLARANS algorithm, to discover the implicit communities hidden in tweet datasets.

In addition, an adaptive k  strategy is utilized to make the approach more applicable. The performance of the approach is demonstrated with experiments on tweet data collected from SINA Weibo.},

 abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of combining link and content analysis for community detection from networked data, such as paper citation networks and Word Wide Web. Most existing approaches combine link and content information by a generative model that generates both links and contents via a shared set of community memberships. These generative models have some shortcomings in that they failed to consider additional factors that could affect the community memberships and isolate the contents that are irrelevant to community memberships. To explicitly address these shortcomings, we propose a discriminative model for combining the link and content analysis for community detection. First, we propose a conditional model for link analysis and in the model, we introduce hidden variables to explicitly model the popularity of nodes. Second, to alleviate the impact of irrelevant content attributes, we develop a discriminative model for content analysis. These two models are unified seamlessly via the community memberships. We present efficient algorithms to solve the related optimization problems based on bound optimization and alternating projection. Extensive experiments with benchmark data sets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for combining link and content analysis for community detection.},

The recently introduced framework of probabilistic relational models (PRMs) embraces the object-relational nature of structured data by capturing probabilistic interactions between attributes of related entities. In this paper, we extend this framework by modeling interactions between the attributes and the link structure itself. An advantage of our approach is a unified generative model for both content and relational structure. We propose two mechanisms for representing a probabilistic distribution over link structures: reference uncertainty, and existence uncertainty. We describe the appropriate conditions for using each model and present learning algorithms for each. We present experimental results showing that the learned models can be used to predict link structure and, moreover, the observed link structure can be used to provide better predictions for the attributes in the model.},

Focusing on biological sciences, we explore an internal soft-classification structure of articles based only on semantic decompositions of abstracts and bibliographies and compare it with the formal discipline classifications. Our model assumes that there is a fixed number of internal categories, each characterized by multinomial distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in bibliographies).

We present two different models called the Pairwise-Link-LDA and the Link-PLSA-LDA models. The Pairwise-Link-LDA model combines the ideas of LDA [4] and Mixed Membership Block Stochastic Models [1] and allows modeling arbitrary link structure. However, the model is computationally expensive, since it involves modeling the presence or absence of a citation (link) between every pair of documents. The second model solves this problem by assuming that the link structure is a bipartite graph. As the name indicates, Link-PLSA-LDA model combines the LDA and PLSA models into a single graphical model. Our experiments on a subset of Citeseer data show that both these models are able to predict unseen data better than the baseline model of Erosheva and Lafferty [8], by capturing the notion of topical similarity between the contents of the cited and citing documents. Our experiments on two different data sets on the link prediction task show that the Link-PLSA-LDA model performs the best on the citation prediction task, while also remaining highly scalable. In addition, we also present some interesting visualizations generated by each of the models.},

In this paper we present a probabilistic generative model for hypertext document collections that explicitly models the generation of links. Specifically, links from a word w to a document d depend directly on how frequent the topic of w is in d, in addition to the in-degree of d. We show how to perform EM learning on this model efficiently. By not modeling links as analogous to words, we end up using far fewer free parameters and obtain better link prediction results.},

 abstract={The world wide web contains rich textual contents that areinterconnected via complex hyperlinks. This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample. It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure. The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage. Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features. Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors. Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.},

 abstract={ABSTRACT  Extended Abstract 1 Introduction Clustering is an important problem with many applications, and a number of different algorithms and methods have emerged over the years. The goal of clustering is to group data points into homogeneous groups, where the homogeneity is usually measured by distances or similarities among data points. Recently, may applications face the requirement of clustering by data fusion. This is because that information contained in single data source is limited by its specific observation, therefore, combining multiple observations might facilitate the comprehensive understanding of the problem. For instance, in order to investigate memory persistence (long term or short term memory) of bacteria, a bacterium is observed at different experimental conditions and evolutional times [11]. Then the multiple observations are categorized by clustering algorithms. In scientometrics, a strategy has been proposed to combine text mining data and bibliometrics data (hybrid clustering) to explore the structure mapping of journal sets [8]. In bioinformatics, high throughput techniques produce numerous genomic data. The challenge to endow clustering algorithm with the ability to retrieve correlated or complementary information about the underlying functional partitions of genes and proteins has attracted many interests [2,14]. Unfortunately, though the machine learning community has already focused on data fusion for classification [7] and novelty detection [5], the extension to unsupervised learning such as clustering, is still an unresolved and ongoing problem. In this paper, we present a unified framework to obtain partitions from heterogeneous sources. When clustering by data fusion, the determination about the "relevance" or "usefulness" of the source is a vital issue to statistically guarantee a lower bound of the performance. In other words, if the clustering algorithm is able to detect the most "relevant" data source, we can expect that the fusion approach works at least as good as the best individual data. In order to achieve the above objective, two different strategies are applied in the framework. The effectiveness of the clustering performance is evaluated on several experiments and applications.},

An improved clustering method based on bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) mechanism and intuitionistic fuzzy set, short for improved BFO, is proposed in this paper, in which the trigonometric function is used to define the membership degrees and the indeterminacy degree is introduced to detect the overlapping modules. In chemotactic operation of BFO, the algorithm initializes a cluster center according to comprehensive network feature value of node and eliminates the isolated point in accordance with edge-clustering coefficient. In the reproduction operation of BFO, the nodes possessing high membership degrees are merged into the cluster that the cluster center belongs to and labeled as visited nodes. Meanwhile, the nodes that also have high indeterminacy degrees are visited again when generating another cluster. The procedure of elimination-dispersal operation is equivalent to the selection of the next cluster center. Finally, the algorithm merges the clusters having high similarity. The results show that the algorithm not only determines the cluster number automatically, improves the f-measure value of cluster results, but also identify the overlaps in protein-protein interaction network successfully. 漏 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 abstract={With the growing number of available social and biological networks, the problem of detecting network community structure is becoming more and more important which acts as the first step to analyze these data. The community structure is generally regarded as that nodes in the same community tend to have more edges and less if they are in different communities. We come up with a probabilistic model for detecting community structure which employs E-M(Expectation-Maximization) algorithm. It is turned out to be powerful and effective by testing simulation data and some widely used data sets.Ren, Wei; Yan, Guiying; Liao, Xiaoping; Cheng, Yukun},
