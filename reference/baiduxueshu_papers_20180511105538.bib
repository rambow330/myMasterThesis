 abstract={Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.},

 abstract={Abstract:  We propose an algorithm for finding overlapping community structure in very large networks. The algorithm is based on the label propagation technique of Raghavan, Albert, and Kumara, but is able to detect communities that overlap. Like the original algorithm, vertices have labels that propagate between neighbouring vertices so that members of a community reach a consensus on their community membership. Our main contribution is to extend the label and propagation step to include information about more than one community: each vertex can now belong to up to v communities, where v is the parameter of the algorithm. Our algorithm can also handle weighted and bipartite networks. Tests on an independently designed set of benchmarks, and on real networks, show the algorithm to be highly effective in recovering overlapping communities. It is also very fast and can process very large and dense networks in a short time.},

 abstract={Finding high quality community helps the users to understand the real complex networks,especially the dynamical analysis of overlapping community structure has the vital significance for community management and evolution.This paper proposes a novel overlapping community detection algorithm called Label-Propagation-Probability-Based(LPPB)algorithm.Each node is assigned a unique label and determined the update order according to the value of node influence.Probability of label propagation depends on the structure propagation characteristics of complex networks and properties of the nodes,meanwhile revising the results from using history information of node label in the process of propagation.Finally nodes with the same tag are divided into one community after propagation,and the overlapping community structure consists of nodes which have more than one label.Experiment results from benchmark datasets and C-DBLP network with time dimension illustrate that LPPB is accurate and stable for overlapping community detection.The dynamic analysis of overlapping structure not only reveals the behavior characteristic of the community overlapping nodes,but also proves that C-DBLP network is undergoing the high "coupling"trend.},
